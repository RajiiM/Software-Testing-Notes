Software
*Set of programs.
*Programs-Set of instructions                    
*We can't touch. We can feel.
*Controls the computer hardware parts.    
*Makes the hardware operational.

Two types:
*Software those are installed in computer
*Software those are worked in browser

Testing: Software those are installed in computer
1]OS Compatibilty Test
2]Location Test & Upgrade Test
3]Un-installation Test (check trial period also)

Testing: Software those are worked in browser
1]Usability Test
2]Link, Navigation Test
3]Security Test
4]Browser Compatibility Test
5]Validation Test
6]Performance Testing

*Business Analyst
*Business Requirement Specification

-------------------------
1]Business Requirement Specification - Agreement Between Client & IT Company

2]Planning - Agreement 
*work -> who?, when?, what?, how?
*developers, testers -> need any training?
*need any software? 
*If we don't have time for complete the project, hire & train programmer & tester.

3]Testing Strategy - Agreement
*Derived from BRS document
*What we done before getting code from developers
*Risk and issues in testing

4]Test case:
*written based on BRS
*Excel, Liber Calc - Table structure
*Test Suite & Test case
Ex:insta -> login, post, reels, logout, notification, followers
Test Suite: Login
Test Case:  Correct Username, Correct Password
            Wrong Username, Wrong Password
		    Correct Username, Wrong Password
		    Wrong Username, Correct Password

Testcase written with strategy
*Boundary Value Analysis -> Mble Number
*Equivalence Class Partitioning -> 2 Street, Blood donor age
*State Transition Test -> ATM number

5]Requirements Traceability Matrix - Document
*Before checking the test case with code, we want to make sure test cases are completed or not
*Compare BRS & Testcase - Create table structure - Decision Table
*Forward traceability & Reverse traceability

6]Required software for testing

7]Developers test the code & submitted to testing team -> Food taste

8]Integration Testing
*Stub
*Driver
*Both are created for temporary use

9]Regression Testing

Block Box Testing
White Box Testing
